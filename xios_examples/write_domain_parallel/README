write_domain_parallel
---------------------

This example demonstrates XIOS parallel write of a decomposed domain to one output NetCDF file.
It sets up a 100 x 100 unstructured horizontal domain with 3 vertical levels and creates a field with sample data. 
Data is written at hourly intervals for 10 timesteps and incremented by 0.2 units.

Unit tests include:

- Checking the output file exists and is named correctly.
- Checking that the file has the correct number of times (10)
- Checking that the average value of the field in level 1 and final 
  timestep matches what we expect based on the starting value and number 
  of timesteps and increment (2.8)
